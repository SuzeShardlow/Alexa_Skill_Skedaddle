## Creating an Alexa Skill for London Underground arrivals

I have now decided to take this one step further and create a custom Alexa skill to retrieve and read out LU arrivals information.

This Alexa skill is being built using Github Projects and Issues as a kanban system.

We are using AWS Lambda and Python.

I am working with a senior developer on this project to get some practise using Github issues, projects and branches.  I am doing all the coding and he is approving my pull requests.
